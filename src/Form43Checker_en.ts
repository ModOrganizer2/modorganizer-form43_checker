      <source>Form 43 (or lower) plugins are modules that were made for Skyrim LE (Oldrim) and have not been properly ported to Skyrim Special Edition, which uses form 44 plugins. This usually results in parts of the mod not working correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be converted, these plugins simply need to be opened and saved with the SSE Creation Kit but their presence can be an indication that a mod was not properly ported to SSE and so can potentially have additional issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Online guides can have more information on how to correctly convert mods for Skyrim SE.&lt;br&gt;</source>
